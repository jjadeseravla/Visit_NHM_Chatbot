# Visit_NHM_Chatbot

JS Chatbot Prototype being developed to see if it can answer simple FAQ from the museum.

## Customise what the Chatbot says  

Add your own strings of questions to the trigger variable and your own answers to the reply variable to make this Chatbot more intelligent.

## How to use

You could install Node to enable the server environment or...
drag and drop the HTML page onto your browser and away you go!
Ask it questions on anything and everything (it all depends how clever you make it.)

## What is the future for this  

At the moment, it is not very clever as it has predetermined questions and answers, however you could use chatbot APIs like Facebook's wit.ai or dialogflow.
